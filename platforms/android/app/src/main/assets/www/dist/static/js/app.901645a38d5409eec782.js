What can I use a personal loan for",ans:"A personal loan can be used for almost any type of expense ranging from big ticket appliance purchases and home renovations to luxury vacations and debt consolidation. Some other cases where personal loans may be useful include payment to unexpected medical bills, investment in business, fixing your car, down payment of new house and much more. "},{question:"Q2. Am I eligible for personal loan",ans:"You must have a regular source of income to avail a personal loan whether you are a salaried individual, self-employed business person or a professional. A person's eligibility is also affected by the company he/she is employed with, his/her credit history his/her residential location and other factors as per the lender’s criteria. "},{question:"Q3. Is there a minimum personal loan amount that I need to borrow",ans:"Yes. Though the exact amount of the minimum personal loan amount varies from one lending institution to another, most lenders have set their minimum personal loan principal amount at Rs. 30,000."},{question:"Q4. How is the maximum loan amount decided",ans:"When calculating the maximum personal loan amount in case of salaried people, the bank/financial institution takes care that the EMI does not exceed 30% to40% of the applicant’s take home salary.  Any existing loans that are being serviced by the applicant are also considered when calculating the personal loan amount. And, for the self employed, the loan value is determined on the basis of the profit earned as per the most recent acknowledged Profit/Loss statement, while taking into account any additional liabilities (such as current loans for business etc.) that the applicant might have."},{question:"Q5. What is the tenure of a personal loan",ans:"Personal loans feature tenure of 1 year to 5 years or 12 to 60 months. In rare cases, shorter or longer personal loan tenures may be allowed by the borrower on a case by case basis."},{question:"Q6. Can I apply for a personal loan jointly with my spouse",ans:"Yes, personal loan can be applied either by yourself (singly) or together with a co-applicant (jointly).The co-applicant needs to be a family member like your spouse or parents.  By getting a co-borrower, your loan application will be processed in a higher income bracket, enabling you to avail a larger loan amount. However, keep in mind that if either you or your co-applicant have poor credit history, the chances of success of your loan application may be adversely affected."},{question:"Q7. What are the key documents required when applying for a personal loan",ans:" Though the documentation requirements of personal loans vary from one financial institution to another, some of the key documents that you would need to provide with your personal loan application include:Income proof (Salary Slip for salaried/recent acknowledged ITR for self-employed)Address Proof DocumentsIdentity Proof Documents and othersCertified copies of degree/license (in case of self-employed professional) and others as per the lender’s criteria."},{question:"Q8. What are the key steps in the loan approval process",ans:"Approval of loan is at the sole discretion of the loan sanctioning officer who bases his/her decision on the basis of the criteria specified by the bank/ financial institution. The entire process can take from about 48 hours to about two week's time. Once all the necessary documents are submitted and the verification process is completed, the loan, if sanctioned, is disbursed within seven working days by the bank. In order to avoid delays in loan processing and disbursement, do keep all necessary documents ready along with the post dated checks (PDC) and/or signed Electronic Clearing System form. "},{question:"Q9. How to decide which bank/financial institution to take the loan from",ans:"It is always a good idea to compare the offers of individual banks before you decide to settle on a specific provider. Use online tools like the loan eligibility calculator and personal loan EMI calculator to find the loan option that suits you the best. Some of the key factors to consider when deciding on a loan provider include interest rates, loan tenure, processing fees and others."},{question:"Q10. How do banks decide the maximum personal loan amount that I can get",ans:"Though loan sanctioning criteria may differ from one bank to another, some of the key factors that determine the maximum loan amount that may be sanctioned to you include – credit score, your current income level and your current liabilities. A high credit score (closer to 900) shows that you have serviced your previous loans and/or credit card dues in a proper manner, which would lead lenders to feel that you are a safe borrower leading to the sanction of a higher loan amount. Your current income level and your liabilities (outstanding credit card dues, unpaid loans, current EMI’s etc.) have a direct bearing on your repayment capacity. Therefore, if you are in a lower income bracket or have a large amount of unpaid credit card bills or outstanding loan EMI, you would be sanctioned for a lower personal loan amount compared to an individual with a higher income or fewer financial liabilities."},{question:"Q11. Should I always choose the lowest possible EMI when choosing my loan provider",ans:" Low EMI offers can typically result from a low interest rate, a long repayment term or a combination of the two factors. Thus in some cases, you might end up paying a lot more to your lender as interest if you choose the lower EMI option. Instead use online tools like the personal loan EMI calculator to figure out your interest payout over the loan tenure and your repayment capacity before making your decision."},{question:"Q12. What are the prevailing rates for personal loans",ans:"  Being unsecured loans, personal loans feature a higher rate of interest as compared to secured loans such as home loans and car loans. At present, many leading banks and NBFCs in India are offering personal loans at interest rates as low as 11.49%. However, the rate of interest applicable to a specific applicant would be contingent on key factors including credit score, income level, loan amount and tenure, previous relationship (savings account, loans or credit cards) with the lender as well as other factors."},{question:"Q13. How do I compare the interest rates of personal loans",ans:" Log on to Paisabazaar.com and fill out our personal loan eligibility tool to get a list of all available personal loan option along with key data such as applicable interest rate, processing fees as well as information about other charges such as pre-payment charges. Using these data, you can easily compare the various personal loan options available with multiple banks and NBFCs. "},{question:"Q14.

Just log on to Paisabazaar.com and fill out the simple form in our Personal Loan sections and in seconds you get information regarding numerous prospective lenders along with the applicable interest rates and various charges including processing fees. You can easily choose the lowest interest rate from the available list and apply for a personal loan within minutes from the convenience of your home or workplace."},{question:"Q15. Is there any extra charge payable when applying for personal loan",ans:"Yes. In addition to the interest payable on the principal amount, there is an additional non-refundable charge that needs to be paid when applying for a personal loan.  Processing fees, which are usually 1%-2% of the loan principal, are charged by the lender to take care of any paperwork that needs to be processed as part of the personal loan application process. This charge may be waived by your lender in case you have a long term association with the lender."},{question:"  Q16. Are personal loan interest rates fixed or floating",ans:"In case of a fixed rate personal loan, your EMI amount remains fixed therefore every month during the loan tenure, you will pay the exact same amount as EMI. In case of a floating rate personal loan, the EMI amount will keep decreasing as it follows the reducing balance method of calculating interest payout on a personal loan. In case of a floating rate, the applicable interest rate may be varied by the bank periodically as per the new MCLR rules, floating interest rates may be changed either on a half yearly or yearly basis."},{question:"Q17. What is the difference between reducing and flat interest rate",ans:"As the name implies, Reducing Balance Interest Rate involves the borrower to pay interest only on the outstanding loan balance, i.e. the balance that remains outstanding after getting reduced by the principal repayment. Flat Interest Rate is wherein the borrower needs to pay interest on the entire loan balance throughout the loan term. Thus, the interest payable does not decrease even as the borrower makes the periodic payments (EMIs)."},{question:"Q18. What is relationship discount",ans:"Relationship discount is an additional benefit that is provided by the banks or lenders to a prospective applicant if they have a pre-existing relationship with the lender. Such pre-existing relationship may include having a salary/savings account with the bank or having an existing credit card, fixed deposit or loan with the prospective lender.  Relationship discounts may result in the lender providing you with discounts when applying for the loan like – waiver of the processing fees, lower interest rates or others."},{question:"Q19. How is the personal loan disbursed",ans:"Once you get approved for a personal loan, you may either receive an account payee cheque/draft equal to the loan amount or get the money deposited automatically into your savings account electronically."},{question:"Q20. How long does it take for personal loan to be disbursed",ans:"You can choose and apply for a personal loan within minutes through Paisabazaar.com. After you have filled out the online application form on our website, the prospective lender gets in touch with you and asks you to provide the relevant documents to support you loan application. Once you have submitted all the relevant documents, the bank may disburse your personal loan as early as the next 48 hours. The usually time frame to complete the loan disbursal process is 3 to 4 working days."},{question:"Q21. Which are the best banks and NBFCs for a personal loan",ans:"Personal loans are offered by all leading banks and numerous NBFCs (non-banking financial companies). Some of the leading providers of personal loans include HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank, Citibank, Axis Bank, Fullerton India, Capital First, State Bank of India and Associates, Indian Bank, Karnataka Bank, Standard Chartered Bank and many others."},{question:"Q22. Is there any Balance Transfer offer on a personal loan",ans:" Are there any benefits of this balance transfer"},{question:"Q23. Why do my initial EMIs have little impact on the principal amount due",ans:"A major portion of your initial EMIs are actually used to pay off the interest dues on your home loan. This process is termed as “front loading”, hence only a small portion of the principal is paid off initially. As you progress further with your EMI, these small decreases in the principal amount add up leading to a decrease in the interest charged on the outstanding amount, thus a larger portion of the EMI is used for paying off the loan principal in later years."},{question:"Q24. What if I default on my scheduled Personal Loan EMIs",ans:"In case you miss your scheduled personal loan EMIs and are unable to make future payments on your personal loan, the lender initially make attempts to recover the due amount through settlements and recovery agents. If such attempts fail and your loan account is marked as a default, this personal loan will show up on your credit report as a default, which will adversely affect your credit score and make it difficult for you to get approval for loans and credit cards in the future."},{question:"Q25. Are there any tax benefits associated with personal loan",ans:" Personal loans usually have no tax benefits, however, in case you take a personal loan for home renovations/down payment, you may be eligible for income tax deduction under section 24. However, this tax benefit is limited to only the interest on the loan and not the principal amount. Also you would have to furnish proper receipts to claim deduction."},{question:"Q26. How to repay the personal loan",ans:"The loan can be repaid in the form of Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) via post-dated cheques   drawn in favour of the bank or by releasing a mandate allowing payment through the Electronic Clearing Services (ECS) system."},{question:"Q27. What are pre-payment/foreclosure charges and how much are they",ans:" In case you decide to pay off your personal loan before the loan tenure is completed, you get charged an additional fee termed as pre-payment/foreclosure charge/penalty. This pre-payment penalty usually ranges between 1% and 2% of the principal outstanding; however, some banks charge a higher amount to foreclose a personal loan."},{question:"Q28. What is the difference between Part payment, Pre-payment and Pre-closure.  Are there any charges related to this",ans:"Pre-closure: Pre-closure refers to completely paying off a personal loan before the loan tenure has ended. Just like pre-payment charge, pre-closure charges range from 2% to 5% of the loan amount."},{question:"Q29. What is credit report and score",ans:"A personal loan is an unsecured loan hence your credit history usually plays a significant role in the loan approval process. There are three credit reporting agencies that operate in India – Equifax, Experian and CIBIL TransUnion. These have tie-ups with various lenders and provide their credit rating services to help lenders evaluate prospective borrowers. Experian India currently has collaboration with Union Bank of India, Sundaram Finance, Punjab National Bank, Magna Finance, Indian Bank, Axis Bank and Federal Bank to provide credit information services. Similarly, Equifax India currently has tie-ups with leading lenders such as State Bank of India, Union Bank of India, Religare Finvest Limited, Kotak Mahindra Prime Limited and Bank of Baroda to provide their credit information services. Apart from banks and NBFCs, individuals can also check their credit score and get a copy of their free credit report online through Paisabazaar.com. Credit Bureau (India) Limited (CIBIL) is third player in the credit reporting marketplace. It is India’s first credit information company that in collaboration with TransUnion, a globally recognised credit reporting agency. The credit reporting agencies – Equifax, Experian and CIBIL TransUnion maintain detailed records of your credit history including repayment track record of all your credit card bills and any current or previous loans. Before approving your loan, the prospective lender cross checks your repayment track record."},{question:"Q30. How is having higher credit score beneficial",ans:"A higher credit score indicates that you have a good track record with respect to loans that you have borrowed in the past. Therefore if you credit score is high (more than 750 in case of CIBIL TransUnion), your chances of being granted a loan are much higher than if you have a lower score. Additionally, you may be able to negotiate benefits such as a lower interest rate, higher loan amount, waiver of processing charges, etc. by leveraging your high credit score. "},{question:"Q31. What do the terms settlement, default and closed mean",ans:" Does it affect my credit score"},{question:"Q32. How is personal loan different from loan against credit card",ans:"Loan on credit card is an offer that you may be able to avail on your credit card. In many ways a loan offered on a credit card is similar, especially in terms of the interest rate and the loan tenure. However, a loan on credit card is only applicable to specific credit cards and you cannot approach any company other than your credit card issuer for a loan on credit card. In case of a personal loan, you can approach any lender for the loan.

What is a car loan",ans:"A car loan is a borrowing instrument that a lender such as a bank or NBFC (non-banking financial company) provides an individual allowing him/her to purchase a car. Car loans have gained popularity in recent times as instead of being a luxury item or a symbol of status, cars have grown to become an essential commodity for the continuously growing middle class of India. With the increased popularity of car loans, most banks and NBFCs currently offer this type of loan to individuals who have a good credit history. One point to keep in mind regarding a car loan is the fact that this loan invests in a depreciating asset i.e. the asset (car) bought using this loan is in fact going to cost less over time."},{question:"Q2. Can I get a loan to purchase a used car",ans:"Yes, car loan is offered for pre-used cars. But, the interest rate for such a loan would differ from that of a new car. However, the loan would only cover the price of the car itself, other costs as transfer of registration, etc. will have to borne by you."},{question:"Q3. Do I need collateral for a car loan",ans:"Just as the name suggests, a car loan is a loan granted to an individual interested in buying a car. Therefore a car loan is a secured loan where the car you buy acts as a collateral. Therefore, there is no additional collateral requirement for a car loan. However, you do have to get the RC (registration certificate) of the car endorsed with the bank. This endorsement is cancelled after repayment of the loan is completed."},{question:"Q4. What are the benefits of applying for a car loan with Paisabazaar",ans:"When you input your basic details into the Paisabazaar.com car loan eligibility tool, we provide you with all available options based on the information you provide us. After you get the complete list of lenders who might suit your specific requirement you can compare the various loan options based on tenure, interest rate, maximum loan amount as well as other factors. You can then go ahead and zero in on the offer that is best suited to your specific requirement. Paisabazaar streamlines the loan selection process, allowing you to derive the maximum benefits from your car loan."},{question:"Q5. What is the maximum amount of loan that I can avail",ans:"The maximum loan amount approved may vary from one bank to the other. Usually, banks approve loan amounts that range from 80%–90% of the car’s on-road price. Few banks even lend 100% of the car’s ex-showroom price. In addition to these criteria, the percentage of financing offered depends on the price, type of car (standard/ premium) and whether you are applying for a new or pre-owned car."},{question:"Q6. What documents do I need to submit when applying for a car loan",ans:"Like any other loan that you apply for, a car loan application requires self attested supporting documents such as income (last three pay slips/last acknowledged ITR), address and identity proof documents along with you PAN card. Other documentation requirements, if any, tend to differ from one lender to another."},{question:"Q7. What is the typical tenure of a car loan",ans:"The tenure of a car loan ranges from 1 year to 5 years. The shorter the loan tenure, the higher is the EMI payable and the reverse is true for longer car loan tenures. Currently, a small number of lenders are engaged in providing car loans for longer durations of up to 7 years."},{question:"Q8. Is there a minimum salary requirement to apply for a car loan",ans:"Though most lenders do not specify a minimum salary requirement, your loan application may be rejected in case your salary does not exceed a predetermined threshold level as required by the internal requirement of the bank. In such cases applying with a co-borrower might be a better idea to increase your chances of successfully applying for a car loan."},{question:"Q9. Do I need a loan guarantor or co-borrower",ans:"A loan guarantor or a co-borrower is only required if you are unable to meet the eligibility criteria stated by the lending institution such as monthly income, age or credit score. Otherwise you can apply for a car loan on your own."},{question:"Q10. In which cases can my car loan application be rejected",ans:"Your loan application may be rejected if you have a bad credit score, have defaulted on your repayments or applied for and been rejected for loans multiple times, etc. Also, you should meet the bank’s eligibility criteria such as minimum income level, age, previous relationship with the bank, etc. to get your loan approved."},{question:"Q11. Are there any tax benefits of a car loan",ans:"No. Unlike a home loan, a car loan has no tax savings benefits what so ever. Therefore car loan amounts should always be tied to your actual requirement and splurging on a fancy car by taking a large loan amount is not a good idea."},{question:"Q12. What is the difference between a fixed rate and a floating rate car loan",ans:"In case of a fixed rate car loan, the rate of interest applicable on the car loan remains the same over a period of time. Therefore fixed rate car loans have a specific EMI payout requirement that does not change due to market conditions. In case of a floating rate car loan, the applicable interest rate of the car loan varies periodically as per the decision of the lender. Thus the payable EMI on a floating rate loan may change from time to time."},{question:"Q13. Can interest rates be negotiated",ans:"Yes, you can negotiate the interest rate applicable to your car loan by leveraging your credit history and prior relationship with the prospective lender. The regular payment of EMIs for previous loan/credit cards you had/have with your prospective lender can fetch you a car loan at a preferred (lower) interest rate."},{question:"Q14. How does the implementation of MCLR change the car loan EMI",ans:"As per the RBI directive, from April 2016 onwards, banks are using MCLR (marginal cost of lending rate) to fix the interest rate on various loans including car loans. Currently the MCLR-based car loan rates are slightly lower than the base rate method that banks used earlier. However, changes in CRR, margin, bank operating expenses and deposit interest rates will change the MCLR and by extension the interest rates offered on car loans. Moreover, as per the new regulations, banks are required to revise their loan interest rates every 6 months or on a yearly basis."},{question:"Q15. Can I get financing for insurance and registration",ans:"Car loans do not cover the insurance or registration fees that you have to pay at the time of buying the vehicle. Car insurance, which is mandatory, needs to be purchased separately and all vehicle registration-related costs also have to be borne by you as they are not covered by your car loan. However, there are few banks that cover these costs under special schemes."},{question:"Q16. Can I pre-pay my car loan",ans:"Pre-payment of car loans is allowed by many lenders however there are usually a few terms and conditions attached. For starters, the lenders only allow car loan repayment after you have completed specified loan tenure and there is usually a pre-payment penalty as well. The prepayment penalty charges usually range from 1%-4% of the. It is recommended that you confirm all relevant charges with a bank before you make a pre-payment."},{question:"Q17. Can I sell my car before repayment of the car loan is completed",ans:"No. Lenders who provide car loans to individuals only allow the car to be sold to a new owner when the loan has been paid off in full. This is because, you need to a get a NOC from the bank before you can sell you car and the document is released only after you have paid off the car loan in full."},{question:"Q18. How can I make my loan EMI payments",ans:"Repayment of loan can be done through post dated cheques (PDC) provided by you to your lender when signing up for the car loan. The other option is an auto debit facility where the EMI is automatically debited from your savings account after you have provided an ECS (Electronic Clearing Service) mandate to the lender.  "},{question:"Q19. What if I don't pay EMIs on time",ans:"Generally, banks treat you as a defaulter if you fail to pay two or more EMIs in a timely manner. You will initially be charged a penalty fee and asked to regularise your payments. If you fail to regularise your payments after repeated notifications, the financial institution can legally repossess your vehicle. Subsequently, your credit score will also take a hit and in the future, you will face complications in future loan approvals."},{question:"Q20. What should I do after paying the last EMI",ans:"Once you have paid off your loan in full, the bank issues Form 35 & NOC (No Objection Certificate) to the RTO (Road Transport Office) and the lender’s name will get removed from the RC book endorsement."},{question:"Q21. Should I take a loan from the bank where I have an account",ans:"Instead of going to separate banks in order to find the best car loan deal, log on to Paisabazaar.com and input your basic information. Within minutes you will have a range of options at your finger tips and you can compare available options to zero in on the one that’s best for you. Moreover, it is not mandatory to have an account with the bank which you approach for a loan. You can quite certainly opt for a loan with the bank that offers you the lowest interest rate. But, availing loan from a bank or a lender you have previous experience with may help you get hassle-free approval, faster processing, waiver of processing fees, etc."},{question:"Q22. What is zero percent Financing",ans:"Zero percent financing is an offer provided by a few automobile manufacturers in collaboration with the lender. Under this plan, the automobile manufacturer is responsible for paying back the interest on the car loan to the financier instead of the borrower."},{question:"Q23. Why are zero percent financing car models more expensive than the other ones",ans:"As the manufacturer is liable to pay the interest component of the car loan, the manufacturer would have to maintain a higher profit margin on the sale. That is the reason why, the cost of zero financing car models is usually greater than the cost of car models that do not have this feature.     "},{question:"Q24. Are there any special terms and conditions associated with the zero percent financing option",ans:"There are usually quite a few terms and conditions in case of zero financing options that are not usually applicable in case of a standard car loan. For example, the usual tenure of a zero financing loan ranges from 12 months to 15 months hence your premium payments will be much higher than that in case of a standard car loan. Additionally, you often have to pay a much larger down payment amount as compared to the standard car loan, which is bound to stretch your monthly budget."},{question:"Q25. What are some of the top car loan providers in India",ans:"Car loans are provided by most traditional banks including HDFC Bank, SBI, ICICI Bank, Union Bank, Kotak Bank, Axis Bank and many others. You can easily apply for a car loan with these as well as many others banks through Paisabazaar."},{question:"Q26. Can I take a car loan from lenders other than traditional banks",ans:"Yes.
