By getting a co-borrower, your loan application will be processed in a higher income bracket, enabling you to avail a larger loan amount.

The entire process can take from about 48 hours to about two week\\'s time. Once all the necessary documents are submitted and the verification process is completed, the loan, if sanctioned, is disbursed within seven working days by the bank.

How to decide which bank/financial institution to take the loan from',\n                            ans: 'It is always a good idea to compare the offers of individual banks before you decide to settle on a specific provider.

How do banks decide the maximum personal loan amount that I can get',\n                            ans: 'Though loan sanctioning criteria may differ from one bank to another, some of the key factors that determine the maximum loan amount that may be sanctioned to you include – credit score, your current income level and your current liabilities. A high credit score (closer to 900) shows that you have serviced your previous loans and/or credit card dues in a proper manner, which would lead lenders to feel that you are a safe borrower leading to the sanction of a higher loan amount. Your current income level and your liabilities (outstanding credit card dues, unpaid loans, current EMI’s etc.) have a direct bearing on your repayment capacity. Therefore, if you are in a lower income bracket or have a large amount of unpaid credit card bills or outstanding loan EMI, you would be sanctioned for a lower personal loan amount compared to an individual with a higher income or fewer financial liabilities.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q11. Should I always choose the lowest possible EMI when choosing my loan provider',\n                            ans: ' Low EMI offers can typically result from a low interest rate, a long repayment term or a combination of the two factors. Thus in some cases, you might end up paying a lot more to your lender as interest if you choose the lower EMI option. Instead use online tools like the personal loan EMI calculator to figure out your interest payout over the loan tenure and your repayment capacity before making your decision.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q12.

At present, many leading banks and NBFCs in India are offering personal loans at interest rates as low as 11.49%.

In case of a floating rate personal loan, the EMI amount will keep decreasing as it follows the reducing balance method of calculating interest payout on a personal loan.

What is the difference between reducing and flat interest rate',\n                            ans: 'As the name implies, Reducing Balance Interest Rate involves the borrower to pay interest only on the outstanding loan balance, i.e. the balance that remains outstanding after getting reduced by the principal repayment. Flat Interest Rate is wherein the borrower needs to pay interest on the entire loan balance throughout the loan term. Thus, the interest payable does not decrease even as the borrower makes the periodic payments (EMIs).'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q18.

Such pre-existing relationship may include having a salary/savings account with the bank or having an existing credit card, fixed deposit or loan with the prospective lender.

Why do my initial EMIs have little impact on the principal amount due',\n                            ans: 'A major portion of your initial EMIs are actually used to pay off the interest dues on your home loan. This process is termed as “front loading”, hence only a small portion of the principal is paid off initially. As you progress further with your EMI, these small decreases in the principal amount add up leading to a decrease in the interest charged on the outstanding amount, thus a larger portion of the EMI is used for paying off the loan principal in later years.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q24.

If such attempts fail and your loan account is marked as a default, this personal loan will show up on your credit report as a default, which will adversely affect your credit score and make it difficult for you to get approval for loans and credit cards in the future.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q25. Are there any tax benefits associated with personal loan',\n                            ans: ' Personal loans usually have no tax benefits, however, in case you take a personal loan for home renovations/down payment, you may be eligible for income tax deduction under section 24. However, this tax benefit is limited to only the interest on the loan and not the principal amount. Also you would have to furnish proper receipts to claim deduction.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q26.

This pre-payment penalty usually ranges between 1% and 2% of the principal outstanding; however, some banks charge a higher amount to foreclose a personal loan.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q28.

How is having higher credit score beneficial',\n                            ans: 'A higher credit score indicates that you have a good track record with respect to loans that you have borrowed in the past. Therefore if you credit score is high (more than 750 in case of CIBIL TransUnion), your chances of being granted a loan are much higher than if you have a lower score. Additionally, you may be able to negotiate benefits such as a lower interest rate, higher loan amount, waiver of processing charges, etc. by leveraging your high credit score.

How is personal loan different from loan against credit card',\n                            ans: 'Loan on credit card is an offer that you may be able to avail on your credit card. In many ways a loan offered on a credit card is similar, especially in terms of the interest rate and the loan tenure. However, a loan on credit card is only applicable to specific credit cards and you cannot approach any company other than your credit card issuer for a loan on credit card. In case of a personal loan, you can approach any lender for the loan. Moreover, credit card loans do not require any additional documentation unlike a personal loan application.'\n                        }\n                    ],\n                },\n                creditCard: {\n                    faqName: 'Credit Card',\n                    faqs: [{\n                            question: 'Q1. What is a Credit Card',\n                            ans: 'Credit card is a convenient alternative to cash or check-based transactions issued by banks and financial institutions, enabling the holder to make a purchase (or draw advance cash) on credit. The due amount at the end of the billing cycle may be paid as a lump sum within the due date in smaller installments before the final due date. The purchases that are made using a credit card are in fact short term unsecured micro loans and if paid off within a specified time (interest free period) do not have any interest payouts. Additionally, credit cards allow you to benefit from the option of revolving credit i.e. you might pay off your credit card dues in one go or make multiple small payments to pay off your debt. Also known as plastic money, credit cards have only recently been introduced in India as compared to the western world. According to RBI data, as of December 2015, there were 2.27 crore credit cards in circulation within India. Even better, you can use credit cards not just within India but also worldwide.Credit cards are in fact tools that allow you to pay for goods and services using the bank’s money instead of your own. But this is only for a short period of time because if you fail to pay back the money before the end of your interest-free period, you will be charged interest on the amount owe to the bank.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q2.

This endorsement is cancelled after repayment of the loan is completed.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q4.

What is the maximum amount of loan that I can avail',\n                            ans: 'The maximum loan amount approved may vary from one bank to the other. Usually, banks approve loan amounts that range from 80%–90% of the car’s on-road price. Few banks even lend 100% of the car’s ex-showroom price. In addition to these criteria, the percentage of financing offered depends on the price, type of car (standard/ premium) and whether you are applying for a new or pre-owned car.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q6. What documents do I need to submit when applying for a car loan',\n                            ans: 'Like any other loan that you apply for, a car loan application requires self attested supporting documents such as income (last three pay slips/last acknowledged ITR), address and identity proof documents along with you PAN card. Other documentation requirements, if any, tend to differ from one lender to another.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q7. What is the typical tenure of a car loan',\n                            ans: 'The tenure of a car loan ranges from 1 year to 5 years. The shorter the loan tenure, the higher is the EMI payable and the reverse is true for longer car loan tenures. Currently, a small number of lenders are engaged in providing car loans for longer durations of up to 7 years.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q8. Is there a minimum salary requirement to apply for a car loan',\n                            ans: 'Though most lenders do not specify a minimum salary requirement, your loan application may be rejected in case your salary does not exceed a predetermined threshold level as required by the internal requirement of the bank. In such cases applying with a co-borrower might be a better idea to increase your chances of successfully applying for a car loan.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q9.

Otherwise you can apply for a car loan on your own.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q10. In which cases can my car loan application be rejected',\n                            ans: 'Your loan application may be rejected if you have a bad credit score, have defaulted on your repayments or applied for and been rejected for loans multiple times, etc. Also, you should meet the bank’s eligibility criteria such as minimum income level, age, previous relationship with the bank, etc. to get your loan approved.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q11. Are there any tax benefits of a car loan',\n                            ans: 'No. Unlike a home loan, a car loan has no tax savings benefits what so ever.

What is the difference between a fixed rate and a floating rate car loan',\n                            ans: 'In case of a fixed rate car loan, the rate of interest applicable on the car loan remains the same over a period of time. Therefore fixed rate car loans have a specific EMI payout requirement that does not change due to market conditions. In case of a floating rate car loan, the applicable interest rate of the car loan varies periodically as per the decision of the lender. Thus the payable EMI on a floating rate loan may change from time to time.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q13. Can interest rates be negotiated',\n                            ans: 'Yes, you can negotiate the interest rate applicable to your car loan by leveraging your credit history and prior relationship with the prospective lender. The regular payment of EMIs for previous loan/credit cards you had/have with your prospective lender can fetch you a car loan at a preferred (lower) interest rate.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q14. How does the implementation of MCLR change the car loan EMI',\n                            ans: 'As per the RBI directive, from April 2016 onwards, banks are using MCLR (marginal cost of lending rate) to fix the interest rate on various loans including car loans. Currently the MCLR-based car loan rates are slightly lower than the base rate method that banks used earlier. However, changes in CRR, margin, bank operating expenses and deposit interest rates will change the MCLR and by extension the interest rates offered on car loans. Moreover, as per the new regulations, banks are required to revise their loan interest rates every 6 months or on a yearly basis.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q15. Can I get financing for insurance and registration',\n                            ans: 'Car loans do not cover the insurance or registration fees that you have to pay at the time of buying the vehicle. Car insurance, which is mandatory, needs to be purchased separately and all vehicle registration-related costs also have to be borne by you as they are not covered by your car loan. However, there are few banks that cover these costs under special schemes.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q16. Can I pre-pay my car loan',\n                            ans: 'Pre-payment of car loans is allowed by many lenders however there are usually a few terms and conditions attached. For starters, the lenders only allow car loan repayment after you have completed specified loan tenure and there is usually a pre-payment penalty as well. The prepayment penalty charges usually range from 1%-4% of the. It is recommended that you confirm all relevant charges with a bank before you make a pre-payment.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q17. Can I sell my car before repayment of the car loan is completed',\n                            ans: 'No. Lenders who provide car loans to individuals only allow the car to be sold to a new owner when the loan has been paid off in full. This is because, you need to a get a NOC from the bank before you can sell you car and the document is released only after you have paid off the car loan in full.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q18. How can I make my loan EMI payments',\n                            ans: 'Repayment of loan can be done through post dated cheques (PDC) provided by you to your lender when signing up for the car loan. The other option is an auto debit facility where the EMI is automatically debited from your savings account after you have provided an ECS (Electronic Clearing Service) mandate to the lender.

What if I don\\'t pay EMIs on time',\n                            ans: 'Generally, banks treat you as a defaulter if you fail to pay two or more EMIs in a timely manner. You will initially be charged a penalty fee and asked to regularise your payments. If you fail to regularise your payments after repeated notifications, the financial institution can legally repossess your vehicle. Subsequently, your credit score will also take a hit and in the future, you will face complications in future loan approvals.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q20. What should I do after paying the last EMI',\n                            ans: 'Once you have paid off your loan in full, the bank issues Form 35 & NOC (No Objection Certificate) to the RTO (Road Transport Office) and the lender’s name will get removed from the RC book endorsement.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q21.

Within minutes you will have a range of options at your finger tips and you can compare available options to zero in on the one that’s best for you. Moreover, it is not mandatory to have an account with the bank which you approach for a loan. You can quite certainly opt for a loan with the bank that offers you the lowest interest rate.

What is zero percent Financing',\n                            ans: 'Zero percent financing is an offer provided by a few automobile manufacturers in collaboration with the lender. Under this plan, the automobile manufacturer is responsible for paying back the interest on the car loan to the financier instead of the borrower.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q23. Why are zero percent financing car models more expensive than the other ones',\n                            ans: 'As the manufacturer is liable to pay the interest component of the car loan, the manufacturer would have to maintain a higher profit margin on the sale. That is the reason why, the cost of zero financing car models is usually greater than the cost of car models that do not have this feature.

Are there any special terms and conditions associated with the zero percent financing option',\n                            ans: 'There are usually quite a few terms and conditions in case of zero financing options that are not usually applicable in case of a standard car loan. For example, the usual tenure of a zero financing loan ranges from 12 months to 15 months hence your premium payments will be much higher than that in case of a standard car loan. Additionally, you often have to pay a much larger down payment amount as compared to the standard car loan, which is bound to stretch your monthly budget.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            question: 'Q25.
